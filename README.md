This is a simple image gallery web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to easily navigate through a collection of images using either mouse wheel scrolling or navigation buttons.

## Features

- **Hover Effect**: Images transition from grayscale to full color when hovered over.
- **Responsive Layout**: The gallery adjusts to different screen sizes while maintaining an attractive grid layout.
- **Interactive Navigation**: Use the left and right arrows to navigate through the images in the gallery.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure and content of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout, including the grayscale effect and smooth transitions.
- **JavaScript**: For handling scroll interactions and the navigation buttons.
